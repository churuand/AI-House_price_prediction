# House Price Prediction Using Multilayer Perceptions (MLP)
## About the Project
This project focuses on an in-depth analysis of housing sales in King County, USA, with the objective of gaining valuable insights into the prevailing trends in housing prices within the region. Our approach incorporates both Multilayer Perceptrons, utilizing a Neural Network approach, and Linear Regression models. The project's core objective is to comprehensively evaluate the performance of these two models in the context of housing price prediction.
